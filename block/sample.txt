Subject: RE: Some documents for NTAW construction

Dear Kazuyoshi:

I've read your e-mail concerning the documents for the NTAW construction.

My schedule is not tight this week, so I believe I can make them by the deadline.

I have some questions about making the documents, so I would like to have a short meeting with you before your departure. Please arrange the meeting for us.

I will do my best to live up your expectations.

Thank you,
Rebecca Harris
