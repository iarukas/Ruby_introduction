 am writing to ask you to make some documents for the NTAW construction.

 I have made about half of them, but I urgently need to be out of the office for three days. Therefore, I would like you to make the rest of the documents during my absence.

 The deadline is next Thursday. I apologize for asking you so suddenly, but I need your help.

 I've attached the instructions for making the documents, so please check them and let me know if it is possible for you to work on this.

 Thank you,
 Kazuyoshi Miyazawa
