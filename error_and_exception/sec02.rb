ubject: Request for appointment cancellation

Dear Mr. Takano:

I am writing to let you know I would like to cancel our appointment on October 20th（Mon.）.

Due to an alteration in our business plans, we are afraid our company will not be able to cooperate with your company this time.

We apologize for the sudden cancellation and ask for your understanding.

We are looking forward to having an opportunity to do business with your company in the future.

Sincerely yours,
Billy Edison
