nk you for calling us about our meeting on October 20th. This is to confirm the appointment we made on the phone.

The meeting will start at 3 p.m. that day. We are going to show you samples of soaps and perfumes for your Yokohama shop. As we suggested, we are also going to bring you our new organic incenses for the Asian market.

We are looking forward to seeing you at the meeting.

Sincerely yours,
Tom Jackson
